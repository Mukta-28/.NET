to do : implement the exception handling



State mgmt. 

1. ViewBag
controller to View, only for the same request, values are lost on a Redirect
dynamic object(ExpandoObject)
ViewBag.prop = value;   -----> ViewData["prop"] = value;
int I = ViewBag.prop
ViewBag is a wrapper for ViewData


2. ViewData
controller to View, only for the same request, values are lost on a Redirect
collection
ViewData["key"] = value; - key is string, values is object
int I = (int)ViewData["key"];

3. TempData
controller to View, only for the same request, values ARE NOT lost on a Redirect
collection
TempData["key"] = value; - key is string, values is object
int I = (int)TempData["key"];


4. Session variable
values are stored across requests for a session
